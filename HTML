  <p> The programming language you will learn is Java, which is a high-level language. Other high-level languages you may have heard of include Python, C
and C++, Ruby, and JavaScript.
Before they can run, programs in high-level languages have to be translated
into a low-level language, also called “machine language”. This translation
takes some time, which is a small disadvantage of high-level languages. But
high-level languages have two advantages:
 It is much easier to program in a high-level language. Programs take
less time to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they are more
likely to be correct.
 High-level languages are portable, meaning they can run on different
kinds of computers with few or no modifications. Low-level programs
can only run on one kind of computer, and have to be rewritten to run
on another.
Two kinds of programs translate high-level languages into low-level languages:
interpreters and compilers. An interpreter reads a high-level program and
executes it, meaning that it does what the program says. It processes the program a little at a time, alternately reading lines and performing computations.
Figure 1.1 shows the structure of an interpreter.
In contrast, a compiler reads the entire program and translates it completely
before the program starts running. In this context, the high-level program
4 Chapter 1 The way of the program
Figure 1.1: How interpreted languages are executed.
is called the source code, and the translated program is called the object
code or the executable. Once a program is compiled, you can execute it
repeatedly without further translation. As a result, compiled programs often
run faster than interpreted programs.
Java is both compiled and interpreted. Instead of translating programs directly
into machine language, the Java compiler generates byte code. Similar to
machine language, byte code is easy and fast to interpret. But it is also
portable, so it is possible to compile a Java program on one machine, transfer
the byte code to another machine, and run the byte code on the other machine.
The interpreter that runs byte code is called a “Java Virtual Machine” (JVM).
Figure 1.2: The process of compiling and running a Java program.
Figure 1.2 shows the steps of this process. Although it might seem complicated,
these steps are automated for you in most program development environments.
Usually you only have to press a button or type a single command to compile
and run your program. On the other hand, it is important to know what steps
are happening in the background, so if something goes wrong you can figure
out what it is.</p>

  <header>The Hello World Program</header>  
  <p><code> public class HelloWorld { <br>
    public static void main(String[] args) { <br>
        // Prints "Hello, World" to the terminal window. <br>
        System.out.println("Hello, World"); <br>
    } <br>

}</code></p>  
  <p>Traditionally, the first program you write when learning a new programming
language is called the hello world program. All it does is display the words
“Hello, World!” on the screen. In Java, it looks like this:
1.4 The hello world program 5
public class Hello {
public static void main(String[] args) {
// generate some simple output
System.out.println("Hello, World!");
}
}
When this program runs it displays:
Hello, World!
Notice that the output does not include the quotation marks.
Java programs are made up of class and method definitions, and methods are
made up of statements. A statement is a line of code that performs a basic
operation. In the hello world program, this line is a print statement that
displays a message on the screen:
System.out.println("Hello, World!");
System.out.println displays results on the screen; the name println stands
for “print line”. Confusingly, print can mean both “display on the screen” and
“send to the printer”. In this book, we’ll try to say “display” when we mean
output to the screen. Like most statements, the print statement ends with a
semicolon (;).
Java is “case-sensitive”, which means that uppercase and lowercase are not the
same. In this example, System has to begin with an uppercase letter; system
and SYSTEM won’t work.
A method is a named sequence of statements. This program defines one
method named main:
public static void main(String[] args)
The name and format of main is special: when the program runs, it starts at
the first statement in main and ends when it finishes the last statement. Later,
we will see programs that define more than one method.
A class is a collection of methods. This program defines a class named Hello.
You can give a class any name you like, but it is conventional to start with a
6 Chapter 1 The way of the program
capital letter. The name of the class has to match the name of the file it is in,
so this class has to be in a file named Hello.java.
Java uses squiggly braces ({ and }) to group things together. In Hello.java,
the outermost braces contain the class definition, and the inner braces contain
the method definition.
The line that begins with two slashes (//) is a comment, which is a bit of
English text that explains the code. When the compiler sees //, it ignores
everything from there until the end of the line. Comments have no effect on
the execution of the program, but they make it easier for other programmers
(and your future self) to understand what you meant to do.</p>

<section class="main-section" id="section_3">
  <header>Displaying Strings</header>  
  <p><code>
    public class Hello {<br>
public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
// generate some simple output<br>
System.out.println("Hello, World!"); // first line<br>
System.out.println("How are you?"); // another line<br>
}<br>
} <br>
  </code></p>  
  <p>You can put as many statements as you like in main. For example, to display
more than one line of output:
public class Hello {
public static void main(String[] args) {
// generate some simple output
System.out.println("Hello, World!"); // first line
System.out.println("How are you?"); // another line
}
}
As this example shows, you can put comments at the end of a line as well as
on lines all by themselves.
Phrases that appear in quotation marks are called strings, because they contain a sequence of “characters” strung together. Characters can be letters,
numbers, punctuation marks, symbols, spaces, tabs, etc.
System.out.println appends a special character, called a newline, that
moves to the beginning of the next line. If you don’t want a newline at the
end, you can use print instead of println:
1.6 Escape sequences 7
public class Goodbye {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.print("Goodbye, ");
System.out.println("cruel world");
}
}
In this example, the first statement does not add a newline, so the output
appears on a single line as Goodbye, cruel world. Notice that there is a
space at the end of the first string, which appears in the output.</p>

<section class="main-section" id="section_4">
  <header>Escape Sequences</header>  
  <p><code>System.out.println("She said \"Hello!\" to me.");</code></p>  
  <p>It is possible to display multiple lines of output in just one line of code. You
just have to tell Java where to put the line breaks.
public class Hello {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.print("Hello!\nHow are you doing?\n");
}
}
The output is two lines, each ending with a newline character:
Hello!
How are you doing?
The \n is an escape sequence, which is a sequence of characters that represents a special character. The backslash allows you to “escape” the string’s
literal interpretation. Notice there is no space between \n and How. If you add
a space there, there will be a space at the beginning of the second line.
Another common use of escape sequences is to have quotation marks inside
of strings. Since double quotes indicate the beginning and end of strings, you
need to escape them with a backslash.
System.out.println("She said \"Hello!\" to me.");
8 Chapter 1 The way of the program
\n newline
\t tab
\" double quote
\\ backslash
Table 1.1: Common escape sequences
The result is:
She said "Hello!" to me.

  <p><code>public class Goodbye { <br>
public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
System.out.print("Goodbye, ");<br>
System.out.println("cruel world");<br>
}<br>
}<br>
    <br>
    Versus<br>
    <br>
public class Goodbye { public static void main(String[] args) <br>
{ System.out.print("Goodbye, "); System.out.println<br>
("cruel world");}}<br>
    </code></p>  
  <p>In Java programs, some spaces are required. For example, you need at least
one space between words, so this program is not legal:
publicclassGoodbye{
publicstaticvoidmain(String[] args) {
System.out.print("Goodbye, ");
System.out.println("cruel world");
}
}
But most other spaces are optional. For example, this program is legal:
public class Goodbye {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.print("Goodbye, ");
System.out.println("cruel world");
}
}
The newlines are optional, too. So we could just write:
public class Goodbye { public static void main(String[] args)
{ System.out.print("Goodbye, "); System.out.println</p>
